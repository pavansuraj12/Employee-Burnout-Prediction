# Employee Burnout Prediction

## Introduction

Employee burnout is a significant issue that affects productivity, morale, and overall well-being. This project aims to predict employee burnout using machine learning techniques based on various factors such as work hours, performance metrics, and survey responses. By identifying employees at risk of burnout, organizations can take proactive measures to support their workforce.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data used for analysis and model training.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations summarizing the findings.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes various features that may influence employee burnout, such as:

- **Employee ID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Work Hours**: Number of hours worked by the employee.
- **Performance Score**: Employee's performance evaluation score.
- **Survey Responses**: Responses to employee satisfaction surveys.
- **Burnout**: Binary indicator of whether the employee is experiencing burnout (1) or not (0).

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data is collected from various sources, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency. Missing values are handled appropriately, and relevant features are selected for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to understand the distribution of data, identify trends and patterns, and visualize relationships between different features. This step helps in gaining insights and guiding feature engineering.

### 3. Feature Engineering

New features are created to enhance the predictive power of the model. This includes calculating derived metrics such as work hours per week and normalizing data for better model performance.

### 4. Model Building

Machine learning models are built and trained using the preprocessed data. Various algorithms are tested, and the best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Tuning

The selected model is evaluated on a test set to assess its performance. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model, and cross-validation is used to ensure robustness.

### 6. Documentation and Reporting

The entire process, from data collection to model evaluation, is documented. Reports and visualizations are generated to summarize the findings and provide actionable insights.

## Results

The final model achieves a high level of accuracy in predicting employee burnout. The key factors influencing burnout are identified, and recommendations are provided for mitigating burnout risk.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-burnout-prediction.git
   cd employee-burnout-prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, preprocess it, and build models.

4. **Train and Evaluate Models**:
   Use the scripts in the `src/` directory to process data and train models. The final models will be saved in the `models/` directory.

5. **Generate Reports**:
   Review the generated reports in the `reports/` directory to understand the findings and recommendations.
